### Social Media Performance Analysis

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing engagement data from mock social media accounts, utilizing DataStax Astra DB for data storage and Langflow for workflow creation. The application is built to be scalable and integrates blockchain for distributed data storage. It leverages NVIDIA embeddings and the GROQ model for data processing and analysis. The solution is deployed using Streamlit.

**Features**

1.Scalable: The architecture is designed to handle increasing volumes of social media engagement data.

2.Blockchain for Distributed Data Storage: Ensures data integrity and decentralization by utilizing blockchain technology.

3.NVIDIA Embeddings & GROQ Models: Utilizes NVIDIA embeddings for efficient data processing and GROQ models for advanced analysis.

4.Astra DB & Langflow for Easy Implementation: Data is stored in DataStax Astra DB, and Langflow is used for easy integration and workflow management.

5.Data Visualization: Engagement metrics are visualized for better understanding and decision-making.

6.Easy Integration with Pre-existing Systems: The system is built with flexibility, enabling it to integrate with existing tools and platforms easily.

7.Deployed on Streamlit: The application is deployed on Streamlit, providing a seamless user experience with interactive dashboards.

8.Easy Workflow & Deployability: Langflow simplifies the workflow creation process, making the solution easy to deploy and extend.
